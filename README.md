## Project Description
### Part 1 - Design a Formal Language

Create a non-trivial language of your choice. Your language can be based on patterns, constraints, hobbies, programming languages, or purely imaginative constructs. Get creative and have some fun here. Examples include (but are not limited to): arithmetic expressions, colloquial language (e.g., slang), music, and sports.

Your language must include an alphabet (set of symbols) and a clear set of rules or patterns for valid strings in the language (semantics). A short written explanation (1-2 pages) describing the intent, structure, and purpose of the language must be provided.
### Part 2 - Grammar

Using formal grammar rules (regular, context-free, unrestricted, depending on the complexity of the language), write a precise grammar that generates all valid strings of the language. The grammar should be specified using production rules that clearly define how strings in the language are formed. 
### Part 3 - Automaton

Based on your designed language and grammar, implement an automaton to recognize whether a given string belongs to the language. If your language takes into account memory or state, be sure to use a PDA or Turing machine. For this section of the project I am expecting a visual diagram of your automaton. No hand-drawn visuals will be accepted, you must generate some form of digital automaton (e.g., LaTeX or Graphviz).
### Part 4 - Data Structure

Design and implement a data structure that represents the automaton in memory. The data structure should capture the essential components of the automaton such as states, transitions, start state, accepting states, etc. 

You must include a written description of your data structure, clearly defining each component and how they work.
